1. Explain why do we want sometimes to use setImmediate instead of using setTimeout?
  Both of them invokes callback function asynchronous way, but setTimeout function takes delay time by argument.
  So if we want to invoke function asynchronously without delay, we use setImmediate instead of setTimeout.
  Signature:
    setImmediate(callback[, ...args])
    setTimeout(callback, delay[, ...args])

2. Explain the difference between process.nextTick and setImmediate.
  An event in process.nextTick has the highest priority among all the asynchronous events.
  In other words, callback functions of process.nextTick will be invoked before the callback functions of setImmediate.

  When there are events pushed into nextTick queue, every other event loop queue freezes
  and all events from nextTick queue will be invoked 1 by 1.
  When nextTick queue is empty then event loop will start working.
